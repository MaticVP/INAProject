4. Community Detection in Temporal Networks (Approx. 1 - 1.25 pages)

4.1. Defining Communities in a Dynamic Context
What does a "temporal community" mean? (Persistent groups, groups with dynamic membership, etc.)
4.2. Challenges
Tracking community evolution (birth, death, growth, shrinkage, merge, split).
Computational complexity.
Defining appropriate null models and evaluation metrics.
4.3. Approaches to Temporal Community Detection
Snapshot-Based Methods:
Detecting communities in each snapshot and then matching them across time.
Pros/Cons.
Evolutionary Clustering / Incremental Methods:
Updating community structures as new interactions arrive.
Pros/Cons.
Methods Based on Tensor Factorization or Multilayer Network Representations:
Treating time as an additional dimension.
Pros/Cons.
Dynamic Stochastic Block Models (DSBMs):
Probabilistic models for evolving community structures.
Pros/Cons.
Label Propagation Methods Adapted for Temporal Networks.
4.4. Evaluating Temporal Community Detection
Metrics like Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) adapted for sequences of partitions, temporal modularity.
5. Implementation Example: Temporal Community Detection (Approx. 0.5 - 0.75 page)

5.1. Goal: To illustrate how a temporal community detection algorithm might be implemented or conceptualized.
5.2. Choosing an Algorithm/Approach:
Select a relatively intuitive method (e.g., a snapshot-based approach with matching, or a simplified evolutionary method).
5.3. Conceptual Overview of the Chosen Algorithm:
Step-by-step logic.
5.4. Data Representation for the Implementation:
How the temporal network data would need to be structured (e.g., list of contacts, sequence of adjacency matrices).
5.5. Pseudo-code or High-Level Implementation Steps:
  // Example for a snapshot-based approach
  function temporal_community_detection(snapshots, static_community_algo, matching_threshold):
    all_snapshot_communities = []
    for each snapshot in snapshots:
      communities = static_community_algo(snapshot)
      add communities to all_snapshot_communities

    temporal_communities = []
    // Logic to match communities across snapshots based on overlap (e.g., Jaccard index > matching_threshold)
    // ... identify birth, death, merge, split events ...
    return temporal_communities
5.6. Tools and Libraries (Brief Mention):
Python libraries like Teneto, Pathpy, DyNetX, or general-purpose libraries like NetworkX (for individual snapshots) combined with custom temporal logic.
5.7. Interpreting the Output:
What do the detected temporal communities tell us about the network?
